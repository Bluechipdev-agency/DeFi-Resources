# DeFi-Resources

Welcome to the Blockchain Token Development repository! This repository is designed to help beginner blockchain developers quickly get started with creating, deploying, and testing various token contracts on Ethereum-compatible blockchains. Whether you're looking to deploy a simple ERC-20 token or an ERC-721 NFT with advanced features, this repository has you covered!

The provided code includes various token standards, contract factories, and test setups to guide you through the deployment process. We also provide examples of contract interaction and integration with popular marketplaces like OpenSea.

Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of smart contracts that implement popular token standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and more. It also includes contract factory patterns, operator filters, and other essential functionality like staking, whitelist management, and delegate deployment.

This is a beginner-friendly resource, ideal for anyone who is just starting to learn about blockchain development. All code is written in Solidity, the most commonly used language for Ethereum-based smart contracts.

Getting Started
To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/token-development.git
cd token-development
Install dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up Hardhat: We use Hardhat for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts. If you haven't installed it yet, run:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat
Deploy to Local Network: You can deploy contracts on Hardhat's local network by running:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Run Tests: To run the test suite and ensure everything is working correctly, use:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat test
Contracts
This repository includes a wide range of token contract types. Here are the ones currently available:

ERC-20 Token
The ERC-20 token is the most common type of fungible token. It includes all standard methods like transfer, approve, and transferFrom.

Contract: contracts/ERC20/SimpleERC20.sol
Test: test/ERC20/simpleERC20Test.js
ERC-721 Token
The ERC-721 token is the standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This contract includes minting, transferring, and managing ownership of NFTs.

Contract: contracts/ERC721/SimpleERC721.sol
Test: test/ERC721/simpleERC721Test.js
ERC-1155 Token
The ERC-1155 token is a multi-token standard, allowing multiple types of assets (fungible and non-fungible) to exist in a single contract.

Contract: contracts/ERC1155/SimpleERC1155.sol
Test: test/ERC1155/simpleERC1155Test.js
ERC-3643 Token
The ERC-3643 token standard is designed for securities and tokenized assets. It includes mechanisms for regulatory compliance.

Contract: contracts/ERC3643/SimpleERC3643.sol
Test: test/ERC3643/simpleERC3643Test.js
BEP-20 Token
The BEP-20 token is the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) equivalent of the ERC-20 token. It is fully compatible with the BSC ecosystem.

Contract: contracts/BEP20/SimpleBEP20.sol
Test: test/BEP20/simpleBEP20Test.js
TRC-20 Token
The TRC-20 token is the standard for tokens on the TRON blockchain.

Contract: contracts/TRC20/SimpleTRC20.sol
Test: test/TRC20/simpleTRC20Test.js
SPL Token
The SPL token is the standard for tokens on the Solana blockchain.

Contract: contracts/SPL/SimpleSPL.sol
Test: test/SPL/simpleSPLTest.js
SUI Standard Token
A standard for tokens on the Sui blockchain.

Contract: contracts/SUI/SimpleSUI.sol
Test: test/SUI/simpleSUI.sol
PSP-22 Token
The PSP-22 token is the standard for fungible tokens on the Parachain (Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem).

Contract: contracts/PSP22/SimplePSP22.sol
Test: test/PSP22/simplePSP22Test.js
Delegate Deploy Factory
This contract pattern allows for delegate deployment, where a factory contract can dynamically deploy other contracts, such as ERC-20 tokens.

Contract: contracts/DelegateDeployFactory.sol
Test: test/DelegateDeployFactory/delegateDeployTest.js
Testing
This repository includes test cases for each contract to ensure that the functionality works as expected. Tests are written using Hardhat, Mocha, and Chai.

Run Tests: To run the tests for the contracts, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat test
Test Reports: You can find the results of the tests in the terminal output. If you're using an IDE, you can run the tests within it and see detailed reports.
