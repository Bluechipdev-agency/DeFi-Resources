# DeFi-Resources 🧑‍💻

Welcome to the **Bluechipdev De-Fi Resources** repository! This repository is **designed to help beginner blockchain developers** quickly get started with creating, deploying, and testing various token contracts on Ethereum-compatible blockchains. Whether you're looking to deploy a simple ERC-20 token or an ERC-721 NFT with advanced features, this repository has you covered!

The provided code includes various token standards, contract factories, and test setups to guide you through the deployment process. We also provide examples of contract interaction and integration with popular marketplaces like OpenSea.

## Overview 📘
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of **smart contracts** that implement popular token standards like **ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155,** and more. It also includes contract factory patterns, operator filters, and other essential functionality like staking, whitelist management, and delegate deployment.

This is a **beginner-friendly** resource, ideal for anyone who is just starting to learn about blockchain development. All code is written in Solidity, the most commonly used language for Ethereum-based smart contracts.

## Getting Started 🛠️
To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeFi-Resources.git
cd DeFi-Resources`

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

  `npm install`

Set up Hardhat: We use Hardhat for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts. If you haven't installed it yet, run:

  `npx hardhat`

Deploy to Local Network: You can deploy contracts on Hardhat's local network by running:

  `npx hardhat run /projectname/scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`

Run Tests: To run the test suite and ensure everything is working correctly, use:

  `npx hardhat test`

## Testing ✔️
This repository includes test cases for each contract to ensure that the functionality works as expected. Tests are written using Hardhat, Mocha, and Chai.

Run Tests: To run the tests for the contracts, use the following command:

`npx hardhat test`

Test Reports: You can find the results of the tests in the terminal output. If you're using an IDE, you can run the tests within it and see detailed reports.
